# Semaphore

A semaphore is a synchronization tool that allows multiple routines to access a shared resource in a mutually exclusive way. Semaphores use an integer value to control access to a shared resource and the integer value can be incremented or decremented to allow or deny access to threads.

A common use-case for semaphores is managing access to a limited resource. For instance, a database connection pool or a shared data buffer. Consider a scenario where a program has a pool of database connections that can only handle a limited number of concurrent connections. In order to prevent too many routines from accessing the database simultaneously and overwhelming the connection pool, a semaphore could be used to limit the number of concurrent connections. The semaphore would maintain a count of the available database connections and each thread would need to acquire a permit from the semaphore before accessing the database. When a thread is finished with a database connection, it would release the permit back to the semaphore, allowing another thread to acquire it and use the database connection. This ensures that the number of concurrent connections never exceeds the limit set by the semaphore, preventing resource contention and improving overall system performance.
